# Variables

A simple Rust project demonstrating variable mutability.

## Description

This project shows how to use mutable variables in Rust. The program creates a mutable variable `x`, prints its initial value, changes it, and prints the new value.

## Running the Project

```bash
cargo run
```

## Output

```
The value of x is: 5
The value of x is: 6
```

## Key Concepts

- Variable mutability with `mut` keyword
- Basic printing with `println!` macro
